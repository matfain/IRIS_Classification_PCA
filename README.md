### Pytorch softmax classifier & PCA plotting
In this project I implemented logistic regression using pytorch for multi-class classification task on the classic IRIS dataset.  
In order to visualize the model I used PCA to project the data on a 2 dimensional space so we can:
* Plot the data and see that by simple reduction we can easily recognize the clusters by eye.
* Plot the model's desicion boundaries to understand the softmax classification results in the 2D PCA space.
